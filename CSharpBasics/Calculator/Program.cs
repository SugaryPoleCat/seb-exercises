using System;


/*Instructions:
 * 
 * 
 * We need to create a calculator.
 * I want you to create a calculator for me that takes in 2 values. I also want the calculator to handle different operations like + - * / and % aka modulo.
 * Please make it for me, thanks.
 * 
 */

/*hint
 * You will have to:
 * [  ] Ask user for 1 number
 * [  ] Ask user for operator
 * [  ] Ask user for another number
 * [  ] Perform the math operation and print it to console.
 * We assume the user knows it should be just numbers, we don't need to do errors.
 * 
 * Feel free to check the checkboxes above.
 * 
 * If you don't need a hint, collapse it (click the - next to hint).
 */

/*More detailed hint
 * You will need to look at CSharp Basics and look at how to READ user input and how to PRINT things.
 * You will have to one of the statements, that checks if something matches / is true and such. Look at the i* and s***** statements.
 * You can either create a new METHOD aka FUNCTION, to process your mathematical operation, OUTSIDE of the MAIN function.
